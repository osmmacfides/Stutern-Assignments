          <h4>Origin of Jollof RIce</h4>
          <p>
            The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof
            Empire in the
            14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish
            has its roots
            in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name
            and
            ingredients; for example, in Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof
            derives
            from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu
            jën or
            benachin. In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is "mutually
            intelligible" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.

          <h3>How To Make Jollof Rice</h3>
          <p>
            When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump your
            ingredients in the
            pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call ”concoction”. Each step counts so try to do each of the
            steps in
            detail.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions.
              This should take
              about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato
              flavor; I simply
              fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the
              time this
              ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop
              when the sauce
              becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is
              gone and the
              sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know but just in case, you are still in doubt, I would say
              maybe 20 to 25
              minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but optional) and
              seasoning
              cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir
              in my Rice.
              Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. Now add the
              chicken stock. Give
              it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover
              the rice with
              a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn
              out well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the
              rice is done
              about 20 to 25 minutes.
              Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantain. Sometimes
              with a side of fresh creamy Coleslaw or Nigerian salad. In west Africa, a party such as a wedding ceremony
              or a naming ceremony is not complete without this meal. It is a sure party pleaser.
